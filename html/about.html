                        <p>Hi there! My name is Eli Jackson and I'm a student at Brigham Young University. My education, accomplishments, skills, and experience are all pretty heavily documented in my résumé, so check that out when you get a chance. In this section, I'll mostly just tell you about myself, what I enjoying doing, and some of my big goals.</p>
                        <p>I've been lucky enough to grow up all over the country. It's been a great opportunity to meet lots of people and try new things. My family and I also became super close because of moving so much. Along the way, I've picked up a lot of hobbies. Since I moved to Utah, You can find me snowboarding, dirt biking, and hiking in the mountains most weekends. During the week when I have some free time, playing and watching sports with my friends is huge for me. I have some phenomenal friends.</p>
                        <p class="italics">Here's some pictures of them:</p>

                        <img src="../images/sophie.jpg" alt="A picture of my girlfriend and me in a cave in American Fork Canyon" width="750">
                        <p>I lived in the Philippines for 2 years, and that experience changed my life tremendously. I've never loved a culture so much. It was incredible to learn their language, eat their foods, and grow close to their families. As I continue along my career pathway, I hope to graduate with a Master of Information Systems Management Degree from the Marriott School of Business at BYU. I hope to work on some meaningful and exciting projects following my graduation. Ulitmately though, I would like to end up back in the Philippines. Human trafficking is a huge probelm there, and with the skills I have developed and will continue to develop, I hope to make their world a safer place to be.</p>
                        <p class="italics">Here's a photo of me in the Philippines with some of the people I would love to help protect one day.</p>
